# Assembly Virtual Learning Platform

## 📌 About the Project
**Assembly Virtual Learning Platform** is a web-based learning platform designed to provide an interactive and engaging environment for students to learn and practice assembly language programming. This project is developed as part of the **PRINCIPLES OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS** course.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
### **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- React-based framework for building fast and scalable web applications
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for performance optimization
- TailwindCSS for responsive and modern UI design

### **Backend:** [Go (Golang)](https://go.dev/)
- High-performance backend API using Go
- RESTful API for managing learning content and user interactions
- PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing user progress and course materials
